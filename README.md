# Flash Cards
This is a simple flash cards app to help you learn Japanese. It is built using the [PWA Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-starter-kit), using the default template as the starting point and the [wiki](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-starter-kit/wiki) for configuring and personalizing.

Apart from several game options, `flash-cards` also comes with a stats page that shows you a heatmap of your answers.
